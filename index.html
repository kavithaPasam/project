  <h2>TRIBLE WELFARE</h2>
  <p>Tribal welfare in India refers to the measures taken by the government to improve the lives of
 the tribal communities who constitute a significant proportion of the population in certain regions of the country.
 These communities are often marginalized and face various challenges such as poverty, lack of access to education and healthcare, and discrimination.

The government has implemented various policies and programs aimed at promoting tribal welfare, including the Tribal 
Sub-Plan (TSP) which allocates funds for the development of tribal areas, the Forest Rights Act which grants land rights
 to tribal communities, and the Integrated Tribal Development Program (ITDP) which aims to improve the socio-economic 
conditions of tribal communities.

Despite these initiatives, challenges remain in ensuring the welfare of tribal communities in India. Some of the key 
issues include inadequate implementation of policies, insufficient funding, and lack of participation of tribal communities in decision-making processes.

Efforts to address these challenges and improve the welfare of tribal communities in India are ongoing, with a
 focus on empowering these communities and ensuring their rights are respected and protected.</p>

  <p>Tribal welfare in India encompasses various aspects, including education. Despite efforts to improve access to education for tribal communities, the education gap between tribal and non-tribal communities remains significant. Tribal children often face challenges such as lack of access to schools, inadequate infrastructure, and a shortage of trained teachers.

		<h2 id="development"> DEVELOPMENT  </h2>
  		<p>The development of tribal welfare in India
 		has been an ongoing process aimed at improving the social, economic, and political conditions of the tribal population. Some of the key steps 
		taken towards the development of tribal welfare in India are:
		   </p>
  	  <div class="more">
    	    	<li><b>Legal Framework:</b> The Indian Constitution provides special provisions for the welfare and development of tribal populations. Article 244(1) of the Constitution provides for the creation of autonomous tribal areas, while Article 275
 		provides for grants-in-aid for the development of tribal areas.  </li>
		<li><b>Education:</b> Education is considered one of the most critical factors in the development of tribal welfare. The government has launched several programs to improve the educational opportunities for tribal communities, such as the
		 Eklavya Model Residential Schools and the Ashram Schools. </li> 
		<li><b>Health:</b> The government has launched several health care schemes and programs to improve the health outcomes of tribal populations, such as the National
 		Health Mission and the Mobile Medical Units.  </li>
		<li><b>Livelihoods:</b> Several schemes and programs have been launched to provide livelihood opportunities to tribal communities, such as the National Rural Livelihood Mission, Pradhan Mantri Van Dhan Yojana, and the Tribal Cooperative
 		Marketing Development Federation of India. </li> 
		<li><b>Forest Rights Act:</b> The Forest Rights Act, 2006, aims to recognize the rights of forest-dwelling tribal communities and 
		provide them with secure tenure over forest land.  </li>
		<li><b>Tribal Empowerment:</b> Several programs have been launched to empower tribal communities, such as the Vanbandhu Kalyan Yojana, which aims to provide basic amenities and infrastructure development to tribal communities.
		These steps aim to address the historical marginalization of tribal populations and promote their overall development and welfare. However, more efforts are needed to ensure that tribal communities have access to basic amenities, healthcare, education, and livelihood opportunities.
  		</li>
		
		</ul>
		<p > These steps aim to address the historical marginalization of tribal populations and promote their overall development and welfare.  </p>
